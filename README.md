# Vibe Express

Vibe Express is a SaaS platform designed to capture and monetize users' awkward silences and cringe moments. This application allows users to log their "vibe events" and track monetization through a seamless interface.

## Features

- User account creation and session management with JWT authentication.
- Logging of vibe events with timestamps, types (silence/cringe), and durations.
- Fetching event logs and statistics per session.
- Basic billing integration using the Stripe API to track monetized moments.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js to handle routing and middleware.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user sessions, events, and monetization data.
- **Stripe**: Payment processing platform for handling billing.
